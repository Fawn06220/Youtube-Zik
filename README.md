Hello all !
Really simple to use :

	- "Collection" folder created on app launch if doesn't exist
	- Right click a BLUE music to download it
	- A RED music means that you already own it
	- You can't download twice the same musi
	- Added a "More Results" button to fecth more (actually 17 results)
	- Added mp3/mp4 download format choice
	
That's all folks !
